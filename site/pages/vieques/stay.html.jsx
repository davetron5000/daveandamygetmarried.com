        The packet of travel information that you've hopefully received by now should contain some pointers to places to stay while in Vieques.  <a href="https://tripadvisor.com">Trip Advisor</a> is also an excellent source of places to stay.

        We are getting married near the W hotel, however the island is quite small, so you'll be close by no matter where you stay.  If you lost the travel guide, or didn't receive it, you can <a href="/pdf/travel_guide.pdf">download a PDF</a> or <a href="/us/contact.html">contact us</a> for a copy.
