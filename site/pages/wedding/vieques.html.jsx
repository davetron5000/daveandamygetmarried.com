      <p>
        We got engaged on <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Gorda">Virgin Gorda</a> in the British Virgin Islands, and, as we were leaving the resort in a blissfully relaxed state, we thought &#8220;wouldn’t it be great to get married on a beach?&#8221; Thus, the idea for a Caribbean wedding was hatched!
      </p>
      <p>
        We will admit, Vieques wasn’t our first choice. Our first choice was an even smaller island just north of Vieques called Culebra, where we have gone twice for vacation. Beautiful beaches, awesome snorkeling, hammocks and palm trees...ahhh.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after talking with a wedding planner who has done weddings in <a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culebra,_Puerto_Rico">Culebra</a>, we decided that we should not put our guests through that experience. Though we highly recommend you go there for vacation, it didn’t sound like the island could support a wedding of more than ten people.  Since we wanted all of you there, we had to re-consider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on what we know about Vieques, not only will we get the same beautiful beaches and snorkeling, but there are places to stay where the air-conditioning actually works, we won’t have to import all of the vendors, and none of us will have to rely on a septic system. Everybody wins.
