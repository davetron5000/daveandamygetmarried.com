      <h4>Amy</h4>
      <p>
      I was born and raised in Alexandria, VA. I went off to The College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, VA, where I received my BA in Sociology. I spent my 20s learning Spanish, doing human rights volunteer work in Central America, and starting a career in public health.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2005 I got my Master in Public Health from The George Washington University - my mom’s alma mater, and where my brother will be receiving his PsyD degree just weeks before Dave and I get married.
      </p>
      <p>After about 8 years working in international health, I switched back to a job closer to home. I have worked at <a href="http://www.lungcanceralliance.org" target="_new">Lung Cancer Alliance</a> for the past several years, supporting people who are dealing with lung cancer and helping them find the resources they need to get through it.

      In my free time, I travel, cook, take pictures, read, play in the garden at my dad’s house, dream of having a garden at my house, and try to find time here and there to spend with friends.

      I was born (but not raised) in Alexandria, VA.  I grew up in Hampton, VA and Manassas, VA before going to college at Virginia Tech, where I received my BA in Computer Science (yes, in those days, Computer Science was just an &#8220;art&#8221;).
      </p>
      <p>After college, I worked for a year before getting an MS in Computer Science from Arizona State University.  Not really liking Phoenix all that much, I moved to San Francisco, where I lived for four years while working at a startup during the &#8220;<a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dot-com bubble</a>&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
      Once my company started folding, I moved back to Virginia in 2002.  I worked at a government contractor for 4 years before settling on my current job as a computer programmer for an energy-efficiency startup in Arlington (where I actually got to meet President Obama!).
      </p>
      <p>
      I spend most of my free time either playing bass in my band, cooking, or programming (I <strong>am</strong> a nerd after all :)
