        A serious need for a relaxing vacation brought us to the British Virgin Islands in October. Our vacation started on my birthday, October 8. We flew to San Juan, and then hopped on a smaller flight to Tortola. From there, we took a boat to Virgin Gorda and the Rosewood Little Dix Bay resort.

        Ahhhh.

        We were worried about the weather going into it (okay, at least I was worried), and Day 1 was rainy, but after being upgraded to a junior suite room with a beach view, and getting into the “welcome” bottle of rum in the room, I could have cared less if it rained all weekend. Dave had called ahead and told them it was my birthday, so the staff brought a bottle of champagne and truffles. Dinner in the restaurant was amazing. It was a very good first day.

        On Saturday, we woke up to a cloudless, sunny sky. We weren’t sure what the weather would do so, to take advantage of every sunny moment we might have, we ate breakfast (and developed a momentary addiction to the New York Times Crossword puzzle), and got on our way to The Baths, and area at the southern tip of the island where huge granite boulders crash together forming caves. We hiked a short ways to get to the beach, but instead of going into the area of the boulders, we headed down the beach a ways. It was beautiful too. There were lots of large rocks around, and not many people.

        After a little while of just standing and taking pictures, I noticed that Dave was fidgeting around in the pocket of his swim trunks. “Wait, is he going to?...” Okay, so for a second, I thought, is it possible that there’s a ring in there? Nah. We had been on several other vacations in the past year when I thought he might pop the question, and he didn’t, so I wasn’t getting my hopes up going into this trip. So, I said, “well, should we go over to the caves?” and he said, “well, hang on a second. I have a proposal.”

      <p>
        Now, the funny thing is, “I have a proposal” is a phrase that is not uncommon for Dave to use. For example, I might ask, “do you want to go to dinner or a movie?” and Dave might respond, “well, I have a proposal. Let’s go to the movie and then go to dinner after.” So, even when he said “I have a proposal,” I didn’t expect for the next words to be “will you marry me?” with a ring stuck out!

        But this time it was. :-)
