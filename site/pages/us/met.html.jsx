    It was a Saturday night in February of 2007. There were three bands on the bill at The Red and the Black, a bar/club in northeast DC. Amy and her friends planned to go to see band #2 play, and Dave and his friend planned for band #3, but knew band #2, so they were there for some of that set as well.
    </p><p>
    As everyone knows, Amy is a very outgoing person. She becomes even more outgoing if she has had a few drinks. So she was the perfect choice to manage the mailing list recruitment task for her friends in band #2. Thanks to Amy, just about every single person in the room was added to the mailing list, including Dave and his friend Tony.
    </p><p>
    Now, Amy was not out that particular night looking to meet someone. So when she signed Dave and Tony up for the mailing list and chatted with them for a few minutes, it was not a notable event. And so, when the friend in band #2 mentioned to her a day or two later "I think that he might be interested in you," Amy had no idea who she was talking about. She kinda remembered the red-haired guy (Tony, apparently), because he was really chatty, but the dark-haired guy with the pretty blue eyes? Amy didn’t remember him saying a word the whole time. Meanwhile, Dave had considered asking the band #2's singer about their mailing list girl, who he remembered having a perfectly nice conversation with, but thought it would be too cheesy to ask. So he didn’t.
    </p><p>
    Luckily, Dave was also in a band, and because Amy was intrigued by who he was, she found the band’s MySpace page. She liked their music, and Dave looked pretty attractive. When Amy decides she has nothing to lose by doing something, she usually does it, so that’s how she ended up emailing Dave’s band email address, despite not knowing who would be on the other end.
    </p><p>
    Dave had also spent some time trying to track Amy down by looking through band two’s MySpace "friends" to see if he could find Amy. But, alas, she was slow to social networking and not on MySpace. So when the email came through, he was pretty excited to have heard from her (even though her email was to both him and Tony :).
    </p><p>
    Among other things in common, Dave and Amy figured out that they lived approximately 4 blocks away from each other in Northwest DC, and after a few false starts, got together a few weeks later for a drink. The original first date destination was supposed to be at Helix (a bar located about halfway between the two of them), but when they arrived, it appeared that a speed-dating event was going on. This would have likely resulting in an awkward and confusing evening (especially because neither was clear at this point whether they were on a date or "just hanging out"), so they relocated to Cafe Saint-Ex.
    </p><p>
    Still unsure if it was a date or not, but pretty certain that they got along really well and had a lot in common, they hung out a few more times, until they finally sorted out that the other really was interested, and they have been together ever since!
